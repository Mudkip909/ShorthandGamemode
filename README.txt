Use /gamemode (c/s/a/sp or 0/1/2/3) to quickly change gamemodes.
This mod fixes what mojang did back in 1.13 (Removing shorthand gamemode commands in favor of the longer versions), and will work until that gets fixed.
That is of course, if I keep updating this mod...

Forge compatible, Fabric soon(?)



Only tested on 1.18.2. More versions will come out as I test them.
